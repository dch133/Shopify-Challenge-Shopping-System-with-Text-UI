# Shopping-System-with-Text-UI

The main method is in StoreManagement.java.

This is a text-based UI with some fuctionalities for this store.
1) You can create an order with specific items from the store (dairy or meat)
2) You can view the products left
3) You can view any of the orders you created along with the price to pay for each such order
4) you can add/remove orders

The data for the store (products, lineItems) are hardcoded items.

(I based myself on a BankAccount System I made last year (see my Github) )

I didn't really optimise the code with design patterns since this is very simplistic. 

I did use modularisation to separate the different operations within the Project.

I also used basic OOP to set up the different Elements of this store.
